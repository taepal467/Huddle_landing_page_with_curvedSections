## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- How to change an images color. You can change an image to white by using the folowing css code:
  filter: brightness(0) invert(1)

- How to do email validation by using JavaScript

### Continued development

I need to work more on my mobile-first workflow skills. Although this project is more mobile friendly than the other projects I have completed, it's still not 100% there. The desktop and mobile versions are good. But any screen size between 600-1000 px, the web page looks kind of sloppy.
